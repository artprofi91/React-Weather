# React-Weather

One of my short term goals is to be proficient in React and to achieve this goal I subscribed to the ([Udemy course by Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview)).
The best way to learn React is by building React apps.

Simple React weather app that allows you to browse 5-day weather forecast for the city you want. I used OpenWaetherMap API, Google Maps API and beautiful and expressive sparklines component for React.
